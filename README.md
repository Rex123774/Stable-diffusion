# Stable-diffusion
This the addition implementation of face frontalization using gans.
So stable diffusion is a process of generating cartoonistic images from orginal image
step for generating stable diffusion as follows:-
step1:Clone the respository file from github and unzip the file using !unzip command in google colab
Step2:Run the facegan ipynb file to get the stable diifusion 
There are two  types of files under the zip file as follows
Input:It will be your orginal images you can keep face frontalization output images also(If you want to connect stable Diffusion with the face frontalization)
Output:It only consists of stable diffusion generated images
